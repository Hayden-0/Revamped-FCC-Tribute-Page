                    <li>1884 - When Albert was five he was given a compass by his father. He was fascinated by it and how it worked.</li>
                    <li>1889 - Max introduced Albert to math and science. Albert was ten years old</li>
                    <li>1894 - Albert finished his schooling in Munich with medical training. He moved to Milan with his family.</li>
                    <li>1895 - Albert moved to Switzerland at 16 years old to attend Aarau Cantonal School.</li>
                    <li>1896 - Albert graduates at the top of his class. He was a year younger than the other students.</li>
                    <li>1901 - Albert slacked off in further schooling, even after doing so well. Because of this he had a hard time finding a good job.</li>
                    <li>1902 - Albert Einstein got a job in the patent office. He used his understanding of math and science in his new position, and it made him happy.</li>
                    <li>1905 - Einstein submitted his first paper on his theory of thermodynamics. It was the first of many.</li>
                    <li>1909 - After working at the patent office and writing his theories, Einstein got a job teaching theoretical physics at the University of Zurich.</li>
                    <li>1911 - He was given an invitation to the first-ever world physics conference. He was the youngest physicist there.</li>
                    <li>1913 - He believed science's understanding of gravity was wrong, and he worked on a new theory which he would later test with a solar eclipse.</li>
                    <li>1919 - After publishing his Theory of Relativity and correctly predicting the effects of a solar eclipse, Einstein's name went around the world.</li>
                    <li>1922 - Einstein was awarded his first Nobel Prize. He was on his way to Japan when he got the news.</li>
                    <li>1933 - He visited America for the first time because he feared the rising Nazi party in Germany.</li>
                    <li>1945 - World War II ended and Einstein continued his research. He made advances in heat, gravity, and relativity, and he published over 300 scientific reports.</li>
                    <li>1955 - Albert Einstein died in April of heart failure.</li>
                </ul>
